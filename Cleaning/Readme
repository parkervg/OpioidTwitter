The first file, clean_http.py takes hours to clean. With a set I saved, I attemoted to reduce the amount of "Redos" present. Unfortunety
my scripts runs through the first 300 redos then stops. When I stop the Kernel, it begins to run again, until it reaches half of the present
redos. It will tell you in the script how many "Redos there are". Checking via manual entry, there is no issue with the link where it stops.
